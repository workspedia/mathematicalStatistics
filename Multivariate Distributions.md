***1 Distributions of Two Random Variables***
(Random Vector). Given a random experiment with a sample space C, consider two random variables X1 and X2, which assign to each element c of C one and only one ordered pair of numbers X1(c) = x1, X2(c) = x2. Then we say that (X1,X2) is a random vector. The space of (X1,X2) is the set of ordered pairs D = {(x1, x2) : x1 = X1(c), x2 = X2(c), c âˆˆ C}.

We say a random vector (X1,X2) with space D is of the continuous type if its cdf FX1,X2(x1,x2) is continuous.

We may extend the definition of a pdf fX1,X2(x1,x2) over R2 by using zero elsewhere. 

Let (X1, X2) be a random vector. Then both X1 and X2 are random variables. We can obtain their distributions in terms of the joint distribution of (X1,X2) as follows.

In general, because these distributions are recorded in the margins of the table, we often refer to them as marginal pmfs.

Hence, in the continuous case the marginal pdf of X1 is found by integrating out x2. Similarly, the marginal pdf of X2 is found by integrating out x1.
