****Probability and Distributions    
***1.Introduction

Many kinds of investigations may be characterized in part by the fact that repeated experimentation,   
under essentially the same conditions, is more or less standard procedure.  
But it is characteristic of these experiments that the outcome cannot be predicted with certainty prior to the performance of the experiment.  
__random experiment__:   
1⃣️ a collection of every possible outcome can be described prior to its performance  
2⃣️ this kind of experiment can be repeated under the same conditions  
__sample space__: the collection of every possible outcome  
__relative frequency__: The ratio f/N is called the relative frequency of the event C in these N experiments.  
the number _f_ of times (the __frequency__).  
The ratio _f/N_ is called the __relative frequency__.  
But as N increases, experience indicates that we associate with the event C a number, say p, that is equal or approximately equal to that number about which the relative frequency seems to stabilize.   
Thus, although we cannot predict the outcome of a random experiment, we can, for a large value of N, predict approximately the relative frequency with which the outcome will be in C.   
_p_ would be called the __probability__ of the event _C_.  

The preceding interpretation of probability is sometimes referred to as the relative frequency approach, and it obviously depends upon the fact that an experiment can be repeated under essentially identical conditions.

*** 2. Set Theory  
Accordingly, in describing our sets, we frequently speak of a set of points (a set whose elements are points).  
The notation C = {x : 0 ≤ x ≤ 1} is read “C is the one-dimensional set of points x for which 0≤x≤1.”   
Similarly,C={(x,y):0≤x≤1,0≤y≤1}can be read“C is the two-dimensional set of points (x,y) that are interior to, or on the boundary of, a square with opposite vertices at (0, 0) and (1, 1).”
__subset__ C2 ⊂ C1
__null set__ C = φ. 
The set of all elements that belong to at least one of the sets C1 and C2 is called the __union__ of C1 and C2 __C1 ∪ C2__.  
The set of all elements that belong to each of the sets C1 and C2 is called the __intersection__ of C1 and C2  __C1 ∩ C2__.   
__Venn diagrams__  
In certain discussions or considerations, the totality of all ele- ments that pertain to the discussion can be described. This set of all elements under consideration is given a special name. It is called the space. We often denote spaces by letters such as C and D.  
Let C denote a space and let C be a subset of the set C. The set that consists of all elements of C that are not elements of C is called the comple- ment of C (actually, with respect to C)

***3 The Probability Set Function

We denote this collection of events by B. Technically, such a collection of events is called a σ-field of subsets.   
在数学中，某个集合X上的σ代数（σ-algebra）又叫σ域 ，是X的所有子集的集合（也就是幂集）的一个子集。这个子集满足对于可数个集合的并集运算和补集运算的封闭性（因此对于交集运算也是封闭的）。  
A collection of events whose members are pairwise disjoint is said to be a mutually exclusive collection.  
Let C be a sample space and let B be the set of events. Let P be a real-valued function defined on B. Then P is a probability set function if P satisfies the following three conditions:
