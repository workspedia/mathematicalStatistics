1 The Binomial and Related Distributions.  
2 The Poisson Distribution.  
3 The Γ, χ2, and β Distributions.  
4 The Normal Distribution.  
Motivation for the normal distribution is found in the Central Limit Theorem, which is presented in Section 5.3. This theorem shows that normal distributions provide an important family of distributions for applications and for statistical inference,
in general. 
X has a N(μ,σ2) distribution if and only if Z = X−μ has a N(0,1) distribution.

5 The Multivariate Normal Distribution。
